The referat folder contains the files for a paper I wrote about "adaptive images using CSS" in the form of a website.

The other folder is a small project site about tracking the time and views for YouTube videos watched. They need to be loaded via link at the project's site first.
There's also an option of tracking stats for locally uploaded videos.

Note: sites themselves are in Bulgarian.
